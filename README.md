## Description

This application serves as an online fitness tracker. 

The user is able to update the database with either a resistance or cardio workout. 

This app is an easy to use, intuitive way of documenting information related to the user's fitness goals. 

As usual, I learned the importance of deploying early to Heroku. 

The deployed version of the application can be found at:
